Ayano is the current Student Council Vice President who is known to be secretly in love with [Kyōko Toshinō](https://yuruyuri.fandom.com/wiki/Ky%C5%8Dko_Toshin%C5%8D), whom she always refers to by her full name, usually in the form of an interjection.

Ayano has a tsundere type personality and this shows when she gets embarrassed around Kyōko. Although as of YuruYuri San☆Hai!, Ayano has started getting confident and more honest with her feelings.
